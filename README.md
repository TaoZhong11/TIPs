# Introduction
TIPs works out-of-the-box without requiring any retraining. By inputting a CBCT image, users can obtain both semantic and instance segmentation for teeth and pulps. The final instance labeling follows the FDI World Dental Federation notation.

# System requirement
Since this is a *Linux* based container, please install the container on a Linux system. The supported systems include but not limited to `Ubuntu`, `Debian`, `CentOS` and `Red Hat`. 

The pipeline is developed based on deep convolutional neural network techniques. A GPU (â‰¥4GB) is required to support the processing. 

# Installation

Requirements: `Ubuntu 20.04`, `CUDA 11.8`

1. Create a virtual environment: `conda create -n tips python=3.10 -y` and `conda activate tips `
2. Install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#linux-and-windows-4) 2.0.1: `pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`
3. Install [Mamba](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba): `pip install causal-conv1d>=1.2.0` and `pip install mamba-ssm --no-cache-dir`
4. Download code: `git clone https://github.com/TaoZhong11/TIPs`
5. `cd TIPs` and run `pip install -e .`


sanity test: Enter python command-line interface and run

```bash
import torch
import mamba_ssm
```
# Model download
```bash
